Simple Image Viewer
===================

Siv is a simple and minimal image viewer written in GTK.
No buttons and no fancy gui, only displays what's important; the image.
Aims to be a replacement to feh when running wayland.
I try to avoid xwayland as much as i can to keep things simple and lightweight.
